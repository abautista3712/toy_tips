You will notice this is very straight forward as we do NOT use adjectives so our reviews stay objective. The scores of A through C- indicate how strong a particiular skill is used during play. A score of A indicates the highest score and a score of C- is the lowest. Any toy that scored less than a C- in any of the 4 skill categories (movement, thinking, personality and social interaction) does not pass and will not appear on toytips.com. Our testing methods are strict and for a toy to be listed on toytips.com means it must surpass our strict standards of durability, ease of use, sensibility and value to the consumer. All 4 skills are met with a rating of C- or above. However, keep in mind not all toys utilize the same skills so do not use this as a key to evaluate the toy overall.
