## Description

Toy Tips is the brand founded by Marianne Szymanski that aggregates collections of professional reviews of children's toys from the 1990's and early 2000's. The website was originally built in the 1990's as a leader in entrepenuership for children's toys in the early days of the internet and was developed using MySQL, PHP, WordPress, and some now-obsolete technologies. After some re-developments of the website and unfortunate loss of some of the original source code, Toy Tips was remade in 2021 using the archival MySQL database and updated to use Express, Node, and React. Toy Tips remains a source of useful archival information and postures itself to continue to add reviews on new children's toys going forward.
